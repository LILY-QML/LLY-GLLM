## Introduction: LLY-GLLM

LLY-GLLM, which stands for Generative Large Language Model, is derived from the [LILY Project](http://www.lilyqml.de) and serves as a precursor to a Quantum Large Language Model. It is based on the LLY-GP model and primarily uses quantum circuits to represent words, combining them to form connections. For example, Circuit(King) + Circuit(Woman) = State(Queen). Similar to LLY-GP, these circuits consist of a series of L-gates that are filled with tokens.


LLY-GLLM is available on the [LILY QML platform](https://www.lilyqml.de), making it accessible for researchers and developers.
